Welcome! This page contains the print files for the Remy headband over on @shebuildsrobots. 

Please note that the body is designed to hold two **sub** micro servos ([product link](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2201?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw05i4BhDiARIsAB_2wfC17199SVDxq3_MIeB0UkOc8Iscu5J9I9oaFmnuSxfnjpYNY158c8UaAplYEALw_wcB)). If you'd like to use regular servos, you will want to extend the body cavity.

These files are provided for **personal use only**.

Contributors have provided some modifications to the original `body.stl` file. Thanks @ryanbbernstein for providing the two-part `body_split.stl` which requires gluing but uses fewer supports.

### Construction details

The arms are connected to a hole in the servo arm with floral wire and hot glue. I attached the floral wire around Remy's wrists rather than inside his hands to maximize the amount of space available for hair. 

His arms are connected with jewelry header pin that I curled on both sides with pliers to keep the parts from sliding around.

The whole print is hot glued onto the headband, and the servos are hot glued into the cavity in Remy's back.

I highly recommend making Remy's hands bigger. They only held a few strands of hair, and I needed to use a floss threader to thread my hair.
